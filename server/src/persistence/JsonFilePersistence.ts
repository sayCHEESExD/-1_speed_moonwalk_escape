/**
 * One JSON file, written debounced and ATOMICALLY.
 *
 * Atomic means: to a temp file, fsynced, then renamed over the real one. A
 * crash mid-write therefore leaves either the old file or the new one, never a
 * half-written save - which is the difference between a server restart and
 * every player losing their progression.
 *
 * The routine write is ASYNCHRONOUS, and that is not a micro-optimisation.
 * `fsync` is the slowest call in this file by orders of magnitude, and on a
 * managed host it is not writing to a local SSD - it is writing to a network
 * volume, where a flush costs tens to hundreds of milliseconds rather than a
 * fraction of one. Done synchronously it blocks Node's ONE thread, so the room
 * stops simulating, stops reading input and stops sending patches for the
 * whole flush. Every autosave and every banked stage became a visible hitch
 * for everyone in the room - a stall that simply does not reproduce on
 * localhost, because there the same call is essentially free.
 *
 * `flush()` stays synchronous. It runs on the shutdown path, where there is no
 * event loop left to await on and blocking is the only way to be sure the file
 * is on the disk before the process goes.
