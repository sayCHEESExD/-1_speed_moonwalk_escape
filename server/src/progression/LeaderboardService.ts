 * `PlayerState` the rewards are paid into, and from the profile store for
 * everyone who is not currently connected.
 *
 * Merging those two is the whole job. A live player's state is fresher than
 * their saved profile - Speed accrues continuously and is only written out
 * every few seconds - so the live figure wins wherever both exist, or a player
 * would watch the board show a total they passed a minute ago.
 *
 * Rebuilt on a timer rather than per tick. Sorting every profile on the server
 * twenty times a second to feed a sign on a wall would be the most expensive
 * thing in the room, and nobody can read it that fast.
