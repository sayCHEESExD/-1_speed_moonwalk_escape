/**
 * Display handles.
 *
 * This game has no accounts and asks for no names: a player is a uuid their own
 * browser generated. The scoreboard still has to call them something, so a
 * handle is DERIVED from that id - deterministically, so the same player is the
 * same name on every board, in every session, on every machine, with nothing
 * stored and nothing for a client to assert.
 *
 * Nothing here is secret and nothing here is unique: two ids can collide on a
 * handle. That is fine for a leaderboard and would not be for an identity,
 * which is precisely why the id itself never leaves the server.
