/**
 * Rebirth: the prestige ladder.
 *
 * Ported from the previous games in this series and kept behaviourally
 * identical - a rebirth trades the current level curve for a permanently higher
 * ceiling and a bigger multiplier, and deliberately leaves everything the
 * player earned OUTSIDE that curve alone. Wins and bought speed tiers are permanent
 * unlocks and survive a rebirth untouched.
 *
 * Data-driven: `REBIRTH_TIERS` is the authored head of the ladder and
 * `EXTENSION` continues the same pattern for ever after it, so adding a third
 * rebirth is one row in a table rather than a new branch anywhere.
