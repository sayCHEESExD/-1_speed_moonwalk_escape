/**
 * The gameplay shape of the world: what you can stand on, what stops you, and
 * what kills you.
 *
 * Lives in `shared` because BOTH sides collide against it - the server
 * re-simulates movement against this object and the client predicts against an
 * identical one. A second copy anywhere would be a source of desync, which is
 * why the renderer builds its meshes from the same `COURSE_SOLIDS` array
 * rather than from geometry of its own.
 *
 * Solids are bucketed by Z. The world is a few hundred boxes strung out over
 * two thousand units, and at late-game speeds `stepPlayer` subdivides one
 * frame into dozens of substeps - a linear scan per substep would be the whole
 * frame budget. A bucket lookup makes each test a handful of boxes.
 *
 * TIME is state on this object rather than an argument on every method: the
 * disco balls move, so "is this lethal here" has a different answer second to
 * second. `stepPlayer` sets it once per step from the authoritative clock, so
 * a whole step - and a whole replay - is evaluated against one consistent
 * instant.

 * surface within a step of the feet, and `canLandOn` decides whether the player
 * may actually settle onto it. When the two disagree, every ledge between them
 * - the training deck, the upgrade tiles, the carpet runner - is reported as
 * the floor and then refused as a landing, so the player falls straight through
